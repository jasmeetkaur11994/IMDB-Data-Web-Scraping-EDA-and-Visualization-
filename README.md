# IMDb Web Scraping and Data Visualization Project
This project involves web scraping data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) website and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on the collected data. The data includes information on movies, directors, actors, and ratings. The aim of the project is to gain insights into popular movies, identify trends and patterns in the data, and generate interesting visualizations that communicate these findings effectively.

The project was performed using Python for web scraping, data cleaning, manipulation, and EDA. Tableau was used for statistical analysis and data visualization. The repository contains the following files:

1. python file: A Python script for web scraping data from the IMDb website.
2. dataset: A CSV file containing the scraped data.
3. tableau file: A Tableau file containing the statistical analysis and data visualization.

### Web Scraping
The imdb_scraper.py script uses web scraping techniques to extract data from the IMDb website. The script collects data on popular movies, including movie titles, directors, actors, genres, release dates, and ratings. The data is saved to a CSV file called imdb_data.csv.

### Data Cleaning and EDA
After collecting the data, we performed data cleaning and manipulation using Python. We removed duplicates, handled missing values, and transformed the data into a format suitable for analysis. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.

### Data Visualization
Using Tableau, we created various interactive visualizations to communicate the findings of the EDA. The visualizations include bar charts, scatter plots, and maps. The visualizations provide insights into the most popular movies, top-rated actors and directors, and the relationship between movie ratings and genre.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of web scraping and data visualization in gaining insights into complex datasets. The findings can be useful for movie studios, actors, and directors to identify popular trends and create movies that appeal to a wider audience. The project also highlights the importance of data cleaning and manipulation in ensuring accurate and reliable results
